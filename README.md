# git-touchbar README

I have created this extension for my personal use. But you can use it too. If you have touchbar then only install this.
Things i wanted to add on my touchbar

For git:

1. Commit
2. Push
3. Stage (all)
4. Pull
5. Checkout to...

In Extras ->

1. Console log selected text.
2. Open localhost:3000 (will ask port, but default is 3000)
3. Quick search (Search instantly on google from vscode)

Note: I have added all commands as emojis. it looks cool on touchbar. so you have to get used to it at first.
